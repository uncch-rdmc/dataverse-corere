# CORERE

## Description:
The main goal of the project is to make these verification tools cost-effective and easily accessible, so journals may implement and enforce more rigorous data policies. This will oblige researchers to in turn adopt more transparent practices and promote reproducible research of the highest quality and integrity throughout the scientific community.

## Requirements:
Python 3.7+ required

Docker is needed for deployment of notebook and proxy containers. It can be bypassed for development purposes.

Git is required for corere to manage user upload files and the versions. It is recommended to point Corere to a separate folder from the one used for other Git activities.

A postgres database is also required.

CentOS or RHEL is preferred, but is not required. Corere should also run on macOS.

## Installation:

#### The only installation option currently is a manual install. Docker based installation of the web application is not supported at this time.

### Bare Minimum:

Clone or download this repository. Customize the settings files as needed. If you are not using an email server, use the commented out line in `development.py` to set your emails to print to console. If you do not wish to launch docker containers, ensure `SKIP_DOCKER = True` is enabled in your environment config. You may also need to update your static files path in `base.py`.

Copy the sample env files and fill out there required attributes. 

You will probably want to run corere inside a virtual environment. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html for more info.

You should update your PYTHONPATH with the project folder so django-admin runs as expected: `export PYTHONPATH="/absolute/path/to/dataverse-corere:$PYTHONPATH"`

You will need git installed and will need to create a local folder to point corere towards via the env files. This will be where corere manages file uploads.

### Additional Functionality:

Register your application with Globus for auth (https://auth.globus.org/v2/web/developers/new). You will need to add a block of redirect urls for Corere to use. The format is `http://localhost:[port]/oauth2/callback` . You will need to register port 50020 through 50039. You will also need to register `http://localhost/auth/complete/globus/` for new user registration. Also make sure when copying the client id, to use the one named `Client ID`.

[Insert docker info here]

## Usage

You will need to collect static files before running (and after updating these files) See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/howto/static-files/ for more info.

### First Run

Run the application for development with `python manage.py runserver`. Or if you need (self-signed) ssl use `python manage.py runsslserver`. You should not use these development webservers for production.

Once the app is up and running, go to the Sites section of the admin console and change the names to match your current site. This is used mainly for email formatting.

Upon running the application for the first time, you will also want to set up an admin user. Use `manage.py createsuperuser` and then log in through `youraddress:yourport/admin` . You’ll need to use the admin console though to add these roles to the user so they can access all parts of the workflow. From the admin main page, go to “Users” and select your admin user. Then add these 4 roles: “Role Editor”, “Role Author”, “Role Curator”, “Role Verifier”.
